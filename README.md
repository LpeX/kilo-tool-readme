# Tekken Moveset Extractor By [kiloutre](https://twitter.com/kiloutre) 

This tools main purpose is to port over movelists and mechanics from Tekken Tag 2 into Tekken 7.

It also allows you to change the move set of characters already in Tekken 7 to other characters in the 7 roster.

## Getting Started

This is quite an involved process in this early stage but we are working towards making it more accessable for players in the future.


### Prerequisites

There will be a few programs you will have to aqcuired before being able to use the tool with Tekken 7.

* [Cemu](https://cemu.info/) - A emulator used to run the Wii U port of Tekkken Tag 2
* [Python 3.6.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/) - Packages from Python are needed for this tool to run.
* [PYWIN32 using PIP](http://www.qarevolution.com/5-step-install-pywin32-using-pip/) - Much needed Python extensions
* [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/) - Used to look into the opcodes in Cemu
