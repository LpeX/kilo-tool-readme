# Tekken Moveset Extractor By [kiloutre](https://twitter.com/kiloutre) 

This tools main purpose is to port over movelists and mechanics from Tekken Tag 2 into Tekken 7.

It also allows you to change the move set of characters already in Tekken 7 to other characters in the 7 roster.

## Getting Started

This is quite an involved process in this early stage but we are working towards making it more accessable for players in the future.


### Prerequisites

There will be a few programs you will have to aqcuired before being able to use the tool with Tekken 7.

* [TekkenMovesetExtractor](https://github.com/Kiloutre/TekkenMovesetExtractor/releases/) - The tool that does all the magic.
* [Cemu](https://cemu.info/) - A emulator used to run the Wii U port of Tekkken Tag 2.
* [Python 3.6.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/) - Packages from Python are needed for this tool to run.
* [PYWIN32 using PIP](http://www.qarevolution.com/5-step-install-pywin32-using-pip/) - Much needed Python extensions.
* [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/) - Used to look into the opcodes in Cemu.
* [Wii U Games Files For Tekken Tag 2] - You will have to aquire this yourself

### Installing

### Python 3.6.5

1. Download version 3.6.5 of Python from the link provided. Making sure to pick the "Windows x86-64 executable installer" under files, if you're running windows that is.

2. Make sure during installation you've checked the "Add Python 3.6 to PATH" option

3. Go Through the normal steps of the installion and take note of where you've installed it as that will come in handy in the future.

4. Once setup has completed hit close.

### PYWIN32 using PIP

1. Make sure this is done after installing Python 3.6.5

2. Follow the instructions on the link provided in Prerequisites

3. If you get a warning saying " WARNING: You are using pip version 19.2.3, however version 20.1.1 is available. You should consider upgrading via the 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command." Ignore it as the version provided is fine

### Cemu:

1. To install Cemu head to their main website located [here](https://cemu.info/)and download the latest verison.

2. The only setting you will need to change in Cemu are the input ones as you will have to navigate the menus.

3. Wii U game files will come pacakged as such:

4. Click File -> Load and navigate to the code folder shown in the image above.

5. This folder contains the file we will use to run Tag 2: Tekken.rpx

6. Tag 2 should now launch and if you've set your input settings up correctly you should be able to navigate the menus.

7. Leave Cemu running in the back ground while you setup Cheat Engine.

Note: Take note of what version of Tekken Tag 2 you have as there will be 2: US & EU. The US version requires an extra step I will detail later.
